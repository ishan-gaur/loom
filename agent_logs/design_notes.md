It's still a bit hard to use this agent as a tool to come up with a good design. Maybe I should have it collaborate with me on a small description of what we want to do first?

I think often I will want to jump back to some previous part of the chat history, but might not want to scroll. Some way the model can just get the request for what I'm looking for and show me would be cool. Or if it can explicitly search its chat history instead of taking the entire chat history as input every time.
