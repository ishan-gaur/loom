# Development Context

## Working Style
- Incremental changes, not large rewrites
- Allow course correction without waiting for long generations

## Loom Project
- Desktop app: voice-only text editing with LLM collaboration
- Goal: uncover STT/TTS/agent system limitations
- Constraint: user understands artifacts without any keystrokes

## Context File
- Purpose: maintain conversation continuity between sessions
- Update as needed, keep small, push all changes to git
