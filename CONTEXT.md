- Allow course correction without waiting for long generations

## Loom Project
- Desktop app: voice-only text editing with LLM collaboration
- Goal: uncover STT/TTS/agent system limitations
- Constraint: user understands artifacts without any keystrokes

## Context File
- Update as needed, keep small, push all changes to git
