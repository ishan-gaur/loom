# Loom: Voice-Based Text Editor with LLM Collaboration

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a desktop application for text editing that centers around voice-based collaboration with an LLM agent.

**Purpose**: Uncover holes in current STT, TTS, and agent systems by pushing them to their limits.

**Core Constraint**: Users must completely understand their artifacts (blog posts, code, mathematical proofs, etc.) without typing a single keystroke. Every interaction must be done through voice command only.

## What We're Building

A desktop application where:
- All text creation and editing happens through voice commands
- An LLM agent assists with the collaborative editing process
- Users can produce complete, understood artifacts without any keyboard input
- We stress-test current voice and AI technologies to find their breaking points

## Key Challenges to Explore

- How well can current STT handle technical vocabulary, code syntax, and complex editing commands?
- Can TTS effectively communicate document state and changes back to users?
- How effectively can LLM agents interpret voice-based editing intentions?
- What are the limits of voice-only document navigation and manipulation?
- How do users maintain understanding of complex documents through voice-only interaction?
